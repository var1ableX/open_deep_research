        "content": "In November 2025, Google disclosed and rapidly patched two high-severity zero-day vulnerabilities in the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine—CVE-2025-13223 and CVE-2025-13224—following confirmed, in-the-wild exploitation of the former. The attack exploited a type confusion flaw that allowed remote code execution simply by having a user visit a malicious webpage, sidestepping the need for downloads or complex user interaction. While Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG) detected exploitation of CVE-2025-13223, there has been no public attribution to specific threat actors and no evidence of exploitation tools or frameworks beyond bespoke exploit code. Google’s internal AI tool, \"Big Sleep,\" discovered CVE-2025-13224, underscoring both the sophistication of attackers and the significance of automated defenders.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n- **Vector / Entry Point —** User visits a malicious website that abuses a type confusion bug in V8; exploitation requires only a browser-based visit, with no downloads or further interaction needed[1][2][4][9].\n- **Impact —** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary code inside the Chrome browser process, with the potential for credential theft, browser/session hijacking, and broader system compromise via privilege escalation chaining[1][4][5][11].\n- **Actor / Attribution —** Exploitation of CVE-2025-13223 was confirmed by Google TAG, but as of this writing, no attackers have been publicly identified or attributed[4][9].\n- **Technique / Innovation —** The vulnerabilities stem from type confusion enabling heap corruption in the V8 engine, representing a well-known attack avenue but executed as a stealth drive-by, exploiting the lack of user barriers in browser execution[1][2][4][5][7][8].\n- **Relevance —** Enterprise risk is acute given cross-platform exposure (Windows, macOS, Linux), the lack of warning for users, and rapid adversary weaponization; all browser-dependent business processes are at immediate risk until patched[2][6].\n\n---"

The lack of public attribution and absence of known attacker tools emphasizes the stealth and technical sophistication of the campaign, demanding immediate, layered defense in the enterprise. Rapid, organization-wide patching remains the most effective countermeasure against such zero-day browser threats.\n\n---"
