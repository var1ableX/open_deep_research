        "content": "A targeted surveillance campaign using the LandFall spyware exploited a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-21042) in Samsung Galaxy smartphones from July 2024 to April 2025. Attackers delivered the exploit via malicious DNG image files sent on WhatsApp, enabling zero-click arbitrary code execution on Galaxy S22, S23, S24, Z Fold 4, and Z Flip 4 devices. Once activated, LandFall manipulated SELinux policies for deep persistence and exfiltrated sensitive user data including microphone, call audio, location, photos, SMS, and browsing history. The operation focused on precision attacks against individuals predominantly in Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Morocco, with infrastructure and tradecraft echoing those of recognized commercial surveillance vendors like Stealth Falcon. No attacker has been conclusively identified, but the campaign’s technical sophistication, narrow targeting, and extended undetected run mark it as a strategic threat to mobile device integrity.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n- **Vector / Entry Point:** Zero-click delivery of malicious DNG images via WhatsApp, secretly exploiting Samsung’s image processing library.\n- **Impact:** Full device surveillance including call and microphone recording, location tracking, photos, contacts, SMS, and browsing history exfiltration.\n- **Actor / Attribution:** Precise links are unconfirmed; infrastructure and TTPs share notable resemblance to Stealth Falcon, with some loader similarities to NSO Group.\n- **Technique / Innovation:** Use of malformed DNG files embedding ZIP archives as a zero-click exploit chain, SELinux policy subversion for root-level access, and robust evasion mechanisms.\n- **Relevance:** Demonstrates rising exploitation of media parsing flaws in mobile platforms and the reach of advanced commercial spyware through everyday apps."

        "content": "- Primary payload is the LandFall spyware, delivered as part of a modular loader framework (notably, binaries b.so and l.so).\n- The exploit leverages CVE-2025-21042, a critical out-of-bounds write in Samsung’s libimagecodec.quram.so, to achieve zero-click code execution when a DNG image is received and processed[7][9][10].\n- Malicious DNG files append a ZIP-encoded payload containing Android shared objects for the loader (initialization), SELinux policy manipulation (for root/persistence), and additional surveillance modules.\n- Once resident, LandFall manipulates SELinux, providing the spyware broad system privileges and persistence even after reboot[1][4][6].\n- The implant fingerprints devices (collecting IMEI/IMSI/SIM/app lists) and initiates surveillance: recording microphone/calls, logging location, accessing contacts, SMS, files, and browsing history.\n- Exfiltrated data and C2 traffic are concealed via HTTPS with evasion features including debugger detection, certificate pinning, and redundancy through multiple servers[1][6][10][11].\n- Tools and infrastructure closely mirror commercial spyware TTPs; notable parallels in loader design and communications exist with NSO/Stealth Falcon, but with unique DNG/ZIP exploit innovation[1][4][6]."

Attackers gained persistent access to microphones, call audio, photos, messages, contacts, device identifiers, files, GPS and network location—all exfiltrated periodically to external servers. The operation enabled deep surveillance of targeted individuals with implications for privacy, physical security, and secondary victim exposure (through compromised communications and contacts). While mass infection was not observed, the campaign underlined the potential for supply-chain-scale abuse of ubiquitous mobile apps when combined with discrete, zero-click vulnerabilities in popular device models. Samsung issued a patch in April 2025, but exploitation persisted covertly for over nine months[1][4][6][7][10][11]."

Its ability to deliver a full surveillance suite with no visible user action, survive device reboots, and evade forensic controls underscores the increasing danger posed by well-resourced commercial spyware actors exploiting platform-level media parsing bugs. While precise attribution remains unconfirmed, the operation’s technical proximity to recognized surveillance vendors heightens the risk of similar campaigns migrating to other devices and regions, particularly as mobile messaging and image sharing continue to escalate as vectors."
