        "content": "Between July 2024 and April 2025, a highly targeted spyware campaign delivered the commercial-grade Android malware \"LandFall\" to Samsung Galaxy S22, S23, S24, Z Fold 4, and Z Flip 4 devices by exploiting the zero-day vulnerability CVE-2025-21042 in Samsung’s proprietary image processing library. Attackers utilized malicious DNG (Digital Negative) image files sent via WhatsApp to initiate a zero-click infection, granting covert access to device microphones, location services, messages, and files. The campaign’s technical infrastructure and loader naming conventions exhibit similarities to those of Stealth Falcon and commercial spyware entities like NSO Group, though formal attribution remains inconclusive. The incident underscores the growing threat from sophisticated, persistent espionage leveraging zero-days and messaging app delivery to target high-value mobile devices, especially in the Middle East.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n- **Vector / Entry Point:** Specially crafted DNG image files sent over WhatsApp leveraged a zero-click exploit in Samsung’s image parsing library (CVE-2025-21042).\n- **Impact:** Full-device compromise enabled audio recording, data exfiltration (photos, contacts, SMS, files), location and call tracking; targeting Samsung flagship devices, with victims predominantly in Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Morocco.\n- **Actor / Attribution:** Infrastructure and tradecraft align with Stealth Falcon and other commercial spyware vendors; no direct attribution established.\n- **Technique / Innovation:** Zero-click, WhatsApp-based exploit chain using malicious images; advanced persistence and evasion via SELinux policy manipulation.\n- **Relevance:** Reveals critical weaknesses in mobile platform image parsing; exemplifies stealth commercial spyware targeting using popular, widely trusted messaging services."

Highlights how image auto-download features in major messaging apps are prime delivery vectors for stealthy attacks[1][2][3][4][5][7][8][9][10][11]."

The campaign weaponized an unpatched flaw in Samsung’s proprietary image libraries, exploiting the confluence of trusted messaging platforms, device auto-download features, and delayed patch cycles. By leveraging a zero-click, zero-day exploit, the attackers bypassed conventional user-driven protections, established persistent surveillance, and exfiltrated sensitive data. The operation’s sophistication—seen in its multilayered evasion, persistence, and tailored targeting—reflects a new baseline for private sector offensive actors. With emerging evidence of infrastructure reuse and modular attack architecture, LandFall signifies a major escalation in the commercial spyware threat landscape, particularly for users and organizations in geopolitically sensitive regions."

Exposed organizations should consider immediate patching of all susceptible Samsung devices to the April 2025 security release to close this critical zero-day exposure."
