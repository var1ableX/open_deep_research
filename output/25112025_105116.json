The approach and findings are strictly limited to information accessible from MCP, as per the research brief. No external resources or internet searches are included. The research process consisted of systematic MCP queries, with outcomes detailed below."

This limits exposed organizations’ ability to reference or act on MCP-hosted marketing insights from Krebs, potentially constraining strategic planning.
