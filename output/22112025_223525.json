The RAG tool’s current configuration provides direct access only to the content or representative text of each document, without explicit metadata such as titles, categories, publication dates, document types, or additional descriptors. All findings are based on the most recent direct database queries and reflect the complete and exhaustive selection of accessible documents as of November 22, 2025. As no further metadata is available via the RAG tool, the presentation below lists the raw document content that constitutes the entire accessible inventory."

Metadata is bound to the target data that it describes in a way that the system can interpret, but it need not be stored inside of or proximate to its target data. There may be metadata whose target is itself metadata (e.g., the classification level or impact level of a file name), including self-referential metadata.\"**\n\n3. **\"d.  Distribute documentation to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].\"**\n\n4. **\"Documentation cannot be obtained, organizations may need to recreate the documentation if it is essential to the implementation or operation of the controls. The protection provided for the documentation is commensurate with the security category or classification of the system. Documentation that addresses system vulnerabilities may require an increased level of protection. Secure operation of the system includes initially starting the system and resuming secure system operation after a lapse in system operation.\"**\n\n5. **\"b.  Employ [Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms or manual processes] to assist users in making information sharing and collaboration decisions.\"**\n\n6. **\"Significantly modified system of records notices to the OMB and appropriate congressional committees for advance review; b.  Publish system of records notices in the Federal Register; and c.  Keep system of records notices accurate, up-to-date, and scoped in accordance with policy.\"**\n\n7. **\"Can introduce vulnerabilities due to errors of omission and commission. The availability of documentation and training can help to ensure a knowledgeable cadre of personnel, all of whom have a critical role in the achievement of principles such as continuous protection. Documentation is written clearly and supported by training that provides security awareness and understanding of security-relevant responsibilities.\"**\n\n8. **\"Once the specific processing purpose has been identified, the purpose is described in the organization’s privacy notices, policies, and any related privacy compliance documentation, including privacy impact assessments, system of records notices, [PRIVACT] statements, computer matching notices, and other applicable Federal Register notices.\"**\n\n9. **\"Websites. Access to certain types of records may not be appropriate (e.g., for federal agencies, law enforcement records within a system of records may be exempt from disclosure under the [PRIVACT]) or may require certain levels of authentication assurance. Organizational personnel consult with the senior agency official for privacy and legal counsel to determine appropriate mechanisms and access rights or limitations.\"**\n\n10. **\"Specify the acceptance criteria for security and privacy assessment plans, flaw remediation processes, and the evidence that the plans and processes have been diligently applied. Methods for reviewing and protecting assessment plans, evidence, and documentation are commensurate with the security category or classification level of the system. Contracts may specify protection requirements for documentation.\"**"
