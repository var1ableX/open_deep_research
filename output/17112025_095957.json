        "content": "A critical authentication bypass vulnerability, CVE-2024-64446, has been actively exploited in Fortinet FortiWeb Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) since early October 2025. Unauthenticated attackers have leveraged a combination of path traversal and authentication bypass to gain full administrative control, creating rogue admin accounts and modifying WAF configurations remotely. The attack targets publicly exposed FortiWeb management interfaces, allowing adversaries to take over devices, disable security controls, exfiltrate sensitive information, and potentially pivot deeper into enterprise environments. This threat’s scale and risk have prompted inclusion in the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, with a U.S. federal remediation mandate and urgent patch guidance issued globally.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n- **Vector / Entry Point** — Attackers target publicly exposed FortiWeb HTTP/HTTPS management interfaces, exploiting a CGI-based API to bypass authentication and escalate privileges.\n- **Impact** — Unauthenticated adversaries can create persistent admin accounts, disable or alter WAF protections, capture or manipulate web traffic, and potentially facilitate further lateral movement; confirmed exploitation in diverse geographic regions.\n- **Actor / Attribution** — No definitive attribution to specific groups or nation-state affiliates; attacks appear opportunistic, leveraging widely circulated public exploit code and scanning from global IPs.\n- **Technique / Innovation** — The attack exploits a novel base64-encoded CGIINFO header to impersonate the built-in admin, bypassing authentication and exploiting flaws in session validation and path traversal logic.\n- **Relevance** — The event underscores systemic risk posed by exposed management interfaces and rapid exploit adoption, and mandates immediate action by all organizations with affected FortiWeb deployments[1][2][3][4][5][6][8][14][15][16]."

Swift exploitation by opportunistic actors before and after official disclosure demonstrates the value and speed with which attackers leverage authentication bypasses and path traversal flaws for immediate, systemic impact. While no advanced group attribution is confirmed, the rapid proliferation of PoC code and global scan activity magnifies exposure. The root cause—combined logic flaws in authentication and session management—enabled unsophisticated attackers to create privileged accounts and seize control of devices in minutes. The scale and severity of this threat drive an urgent need for comprehensive, tactical response."
