This lack of granular detail poses a credible risk of oversight, ambiguity, and inefficiency for exposed organizations managing compliance, audit, or knowledge retrieval functions. Exposed organizations should consider immediately mapping document coverage against operational requirements and implementing structured tagging to mitigate gaps in discoverability and governance."
