        "content": "In November 2025, Google disclosed and rapidly patched two critical zero-day vulnerabilities—CVE-2025-13223 and CVE-2025-13224—in the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine. CVE-2025-13223, identified by Google’s Threat Analysis Group, was already being actively exploited in the wild, while CVE-2025-13224 was discovered by the company's large language model (LLM)-powered tool, Big Sleep. Both vulnerabilities are type confusion bugs that allow attackers to achieve heap memory corruption, potentially enabling arbitrary code execution if a user is lured to a malicious site. The ongoing exploitation underscores targeted, high-impact web attacks against all major platforms, implicating a sizeable portion of the global internet user base and a wide ecosystem of Chromium-derived browsers.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n- **Vector / Entry Point:** Attackers delivered malicious payloads via drive-by compromise—convincing users to visit weaponized web pages exploiting flaws in Chrome’s V8 engine.\n- **Impact:** Successful exploitation allowed remote code execution within the Chrome browser; risk of sandbox escape, credential theft, broader malware deployment, and exposure for other Chromium-based browsers were all confirmed.\n- **Actor / Attribution:** CVE-2025-13223 was discovered by Clément Lecigne (Google TAG); exploitation patterns align with advanced spyware and nation-state groups. CVE-2025-13224 was detected by Google's AI tool, Big Sleep.\n- **Technique / Innovation:** Attackers used advanced, in-the-wild zero-day exploitation of a high-value JavaScript engine (V8 type confusion), targeting multiple OSes and capitalizing on the continued exposure window before patches.\n- **Relevance:** The event highlights the persistent vulnerability of browser engines, the increasing role of AI-based bug discovery, and the necessity of aggressive patch, detection, and user awareness controls across enterprises and consumers alike[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][9][10][11][15]."

No explicit group claim or bespoke APT attribution has been published as of November 2025. TAG’s focus on emerging exploitation campaigns and historic overlap with nation-state-linked activity provide context for the likely threat profile[6]."

The flaws leveraged—type confusion bugs in the JavaScript engine—constitute a persistent, high-value attack pattern. Timely discovery, including Big Sleep’s AI-driven bug hunting, and rapid vendor response limited the exploitation window but did not prevent active attacks before updates were available. The event reaffirms that browser security remains exceptionally dynamic, with both human- and machine-discovered vulnerabilities necessitating urgent patch cycles, upgraded detection, and rigorous endpoint hygiene. The breadth of affected software (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi) greatly amplifies the impact, proving that lagging patch management or user inaction can create persistent organizational vulnerability."
