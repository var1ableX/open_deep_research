        "content": "A critical vulnerability tracked as CVE-2025-64446 has been actively exploited since early October 2025 to compromise Fortinet FortiWeb Web Application Firewall (WAF) appliances. Attackers leverage a combined path traversal and authentication bypass in the FortiWeb API, using crafted HTTP POST requests and forged authentication headers to create unauthorized administrator accounts. The vulnerability impacts devices running FortiWeb versions up to 8.0.1, enabling full administrative takeover without prior authentication. The resulting compromise allows attackers to disable security controls, exfiltrate sensitive configuration data, and establish persistent access to network perimeters. Despite emergency advisories and rapid release of patches by Fortinet, exploitation continues at scale, fueled by public proof-of-concept (PoC) code and automated attack frameworks.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n- **Vector / Entry Point:** Exploitation of a vulnerable FortiWeb API endpoint using a crafted HTTP POST, path traversal in the URL, and a forged base64-encoded authentication header.\n- **Impact:** Unauthenticated creation of rogue admin accounts, granting attackers persistent root-level access to WAF devices and, consequently, the networks they protect.\n- **Actor / Attribution:** No credible attribution to named or nation-state threat actors; exploitation appears automated, opportunistic, and globally distributed.\n- **Technique / Innovation:** Chaining path traversal with authentication bypass via manipulation of the CGIINFO header, abusing internal trust relationships in API input handling.\n- **Relevance:** Highlights ongoing risk from lax API security in network perimeter devices and illustrates the speed at which critical zero-day exploits propagate via public and underground channels."

Activity consists of widespread, opportunistic exploitation traced to many IP addresses globally. Both cybercriminal and gray-market exploit sellers have been observed distributing PoC and potentially private exploit kits. No complex post-exploitation malware or APT tradecraft has been linked to this campaign."

There is no concrete evidence of additional dedicated malware tools being deployed post-compromise, though configuration and account changes are routinely implemented."

Attackers can freely add, remove, or alter administrative users, disable or modify critical security policies, collect or delete logs, and potentially facilitate lateral access into internal network environments. Indicators of compromise include the unexpected presence of administrator accounts (such as “Testpoint”, “trader”, or “trader1”) and observation of HTTP POST requests to CGI endpoints with base64 CGIINFO headers in appliance logs. The rapid exposure of public PoC scripts and black-market sale of working exploits have driven automated, scan-and-compromise activity worldwide, with no confirmed incidents naming specific victim organizations but a strong likelihood that unpatched, exposed FortiWeb devices have been compromised at scale. The architectural role of these devices as perimeter defenses means compromise can have cascading impacts across entire enterprise environments."

The exploitation process is straightforward, requiring only generic HTTP tooling and knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint, thereby enabling indiscriminate, global compromise of unpatched systems. The absence of reliable frontend authentication and the presence of a path traversal flaw lead to trivial administrator impersonation and rogue account creation, undermining the integrity of core network defenses. Widespread public awareness and release of automation scripts have accelerated exploitation beyond targeted attacks into large-scale internet-wide campaigns."
