        "content": "A critical unauthenticated path traversal and authentication bypass vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-64446, has been actively exploited in Fortinet FortiWeb Web Application Firewalls (WAF) since October 2025. Attackers are leveraging this flaw to create rogue administrator accounts remotely, thus gaining full control over affected WAF devices. The issue affects FortiWeb versions 8.0.1 and earlier, and rapid exploitation campaigns have been observed worldwide. CISA included this CVE in its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog on November 14, 2025, mandating immediate patching for federal agencies due to evidence of active in-the-wild exploitation. The incident underscores the growing threat posed by attacks targeting edge network infrastructure and WAF appliances.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n- **Vector / Entry Point:** Attackers exploit a path traversal and authentication bypass vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP POST requests with forged headers to a vulnerable FortiWeb API endpoint[1][2][3][4][5].\n- **Impact:** Full administrative takeover of unpatched FortiWeb devices, including the creation of persistent rogue admin accounts and potential for disabling or altering WAF defenses, exfiltrating configurations, and facilitating broader attacks[1][2][4][6][7].\n- **Actor / Attribution:** Attacks are active, automated, and global. No specific threat actor or group attribution exists—all observed cases involve unauthenticated, unidentified external attackers[2][3][6][7][8].\n- **Technique / Innovation:** Attackers combine URL path traversal with abuse of the CGIINFO HTTP header, impersonating the built-in admin user with no prior authentication. Automated exploit scripts have surfaced rapidly post-disclosure[2][4][9].\n- **Relevance:** The event exemplifies high-priority targeting of internet-facing security gateways, and demonstrates the risk of rapid mass exploitation once a zero-day is made public[1][3][5][6][7]."

The ease of exploitation, global scanning activity, and rapid automation have facilitated ongoing unauthorized creation of admin accounts, granting attackers total device control with minimal technical barrier. The lack of any requirement for prior authentication, coupled with widespread availability of working exploit code, makes this incident a textbook example of modern edge device exploitation. The event’s success is rooted in both the technical depth of the flaw and the failure to restrict management interfaces—a fundamental control gap for critical perimeter infrastructure."
